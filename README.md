# StanfordAdmissionPredictor
Using a deep neural network in tensorflow, get a basic idea of your likelihood of getting into Stanford.

I got this data from https://www.collegedata.com/. If you know of any website with more/bigger datasets please let me know.

This was my first attempt at a deep learning project from scratch, so please don't judge.

There are a few probelms with the code.

For instance, right now I cannot deploy the final model and use it in say a flask website. If you can help me, that would be great. Also, the numbers are a bit too low for what I would expect, which isn't a huge problem but I can't find a decent solution right now.
